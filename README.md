This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an element in an array using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error results from attempting to access an element at an index that does not exist within the array, often leading to undefined behavior or a runtime exception. The solution involves adding error handling to check the index before accessing the element or using safer array access methods.
